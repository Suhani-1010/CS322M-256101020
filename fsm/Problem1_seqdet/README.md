# Sequence Detector (Mealy FSM) â€” Pattern `1101`

This project implements a **Mealy Finite State Machine (FSM)** in Verilog to detect the overlapping binary sequence `1101` in a serial input stream. The output `y` is asserted high (`1`) for exactly one clock cycle when the sequence is detected.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

* Detect sequence `1101` in a serial stream of bits.
* Overlapping sequences should be detected (e.g., input `1101101` should trigger twice).
* Synchronous FSM with **active-high reset**.
* Output `y` goes high **only on the clock cycle when the last `1` of the sequence is received**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ State Definitions

The FSM has **4 states** to track prefix matches:

* **S0 (00)** â†’ Initial state, no bits matched yet.
* **S1 (01)** â†’ Saw `1`.
* **S2 (10)** â†’ Saw `11`.
* **S3 (11)** â†’ Saw `110`.

| Current State | Input (`din`) | Next State | Output (`y`) |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| **S0**        | 0             | S0         | 0            |
|               | 1             | S1         | 0            |
| **S1**        | 0             | S0         | 0            |
|               | 1             | S2         | 0            |
| **S2**        | 0             | S3         | 0            |
|               | 1             | S2         | 0            |
| **S3**        | 0             | S0         | 0            |
|               | 1             | S1         | **1**        |

## ðŸ”¹ Simulation Example

For input stream: `1101101`

* Sequence `1101` detected at index 3 â†’ `y=1`
* Sequence `1101` detected again at index 6 â†’ `y=1`

Output `y` waveform will show **pulses** aligned with detections.

---

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run the Program

### 1. Save the code

Save the Verilog module as `seq_detect_mealy.v`.

### 2. Create a Testbench (example `tb_seq_detect_mealy.v`)

### 3. Compile & Simulate

Using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and **GTKWave**:

```bash
iverilog -o sim.out seq_detect_mealy.v tb_seq_detect_mealy.v
vvp sim.out
gtkwave dump.vcd &
```

### 4. Observe Output

* In the waveform, `y` will pulse **high (1)** whenever the sequence `1101` is detected.

## âœ… Key Notes

* **Mealy FSM**: Output depends on state + input â†’ allows single-cycle detection.
* **Overlap Handling**: After detecting `1101`, FSM returns to `S1` (since last `1` can start a new match).
* **Reset**: Active-high, synchronous.

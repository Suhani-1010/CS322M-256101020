# Traffic Light Controller (FSM)

This project implements a **synchronous finite state machine (FSM)** in Verilog to control a traffic light system with **North-South (NS)** and **East-West (EW)** directions. The design uses a time base (`tick`) to cycle through green, yellow, and red lights.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

* Two directions: **North-South** and **East-West**.
* Lights cycle as follows:

  * **NS Green â†’ NS Yellow â†’ EW Green â†’ EW Yellow â†’ (repeat)**
* Timing:

  * NS Green: 5 ticks
  * NS Yellow: 2 ticks
  * EW Green: 5 ticks
  * EW Yellow: 2 ticks
* Reset (`rst`) sets FSM to **NS Green**.
* `tick` is a **1-cycle pulse** from a slower clock divider.

---

## ðŸ”¹ State Definitions

The FSM has **4 states**:

* **S\_NS\_G (00)** â†’ North-South Green, East-West Red
* **S\_NS\_Y (01)** â†’ North-South Yellow, East-West Red
* **S\_EW\_G (10)** â†’ East-West Green, North-South Red
* **S\_EW\_Y (11)** â†’ East-West Yellow, North-South Red

## ðŸ”¹ State Transition Table

| Current State | Ticks Required | Next State | Lights Active     |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| **S\_NS\_G**  | 5              | S\_NS\_Y   | NS=Green, EW=Red  |
| **S\_NS\_Y**  | 2              | S\_EW\_G   | NS=Yellow, EW=Red |
| **S\_EW\_G**  | 5              | S\_EW\_Y   | EW=Green, NS=Red  |
| **S\_EW\_Y**  | 2              | S\_NS\_G   | EW=Yellow, NS=Red |

## ðŸ”¹ Simulation Example

At each `tick`, the counter increments until the duration expires, then transitions to the next state. Example sequence:

1. Reset â†’ **S\_NS\_G** (NS green, EW red)
2. After 5 ticks â†’ **S\_NS\_Y** (NS yellow, EW red)
3. After 2 ticks â†’ **S\_EW\_G** (EW green, NS red)
4. After 5 ticks â†’ **S\_EW\_Y** (EW yellow, NS red)
5. After 2 ticks â†’ back to **S\_NS\_G**

## ðŸ”¹ How to Run the Program

### 1. Save the code

Save the Verilog module as `traffic_light.v`.

### 2. Create a Testbench (example `tb_traffic_light.v`)

### 3. Compile & Simulate

Using **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** and **GTKWave**:

```bash
iverilog -o sim.out traffic_light.v tb_traffic_light.v
vvp sim.out
gtkwave dump.vcd &
```

### 4. Observe Output

* **NS lights** will be green â†’ yellow â†’ red
* **EW lights** will be red â†’ green â†’ yellow
* Each light duration matches configured tick counts.

## âœ… Key Notes

* **Moore FSM**: Outputs depend only on the current state.
* **Tick-based timing** allows easy scaling by adjusting `DUR_*` parameters.
* **Synchronous reset** ensures safe startup.
